<h2>What are the PostgreSQL Mailing Lists?</h2>

The <a href="https://lists.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL mailing lists</a> are one of the primary ways to interact with the PostgreSQL community. The mailing lists are an effective way to communicate and contribute to PostgreSQL and there are lists that cover a variety of topics, including:

<ul>
  <li>Ongoing PostgreSQL development</li>
  <li>General support</li>
  <li>Product release &amp; event announcements</li>
  <li>Coordinate community outreach</li>
</ul>

and many more.
