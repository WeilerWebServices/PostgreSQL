<h1>Testing <i class="fa fa-code"></i></h1>

<p>
  The stability and performance of PostgreSQL is made possible by the dedicated
  work of people testing and reporting back their findings, whether they are
  <a href="/account/submitbug/">bugs</a>,
  <a href="/support/security/">security issues</a>, or performance problems.
</p>

<p>
  Below are some resources that will help you to test some of the latest code
  that is committed to the PostgreSQL project. These URLs contain information
  about an ongoing beta, the nightly development builds and documentation
  updates.
