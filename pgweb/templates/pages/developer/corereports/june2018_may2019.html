<h1>Core Team Report: June 2018 - May 2019<i class="fas fa-comments"></i></h1>

<p>This is a high level report of the activities of the PostgreSQL Core Team
    during the period of June 2018 to May 2019. This is not an exhaustive list;
    as can be imagined, some activities must be kept confidential for privacy
    and other reasons.</p>

<ol>
    <li><p><b>Multiple requests for approval to use the logo and project
        name.</b></p>

    <p>We received a number of requests from various individuals and
        organisations to use the project logo and name in conjunction with
        events, support and consulting services and production of Open Source
        related swag. None were refused.</p></li>

    <li><p><b>Multiple questions about our licence, all responded to.</b></p>

    <p>We received a number of enquiries about our licence and what types of
        usage it allows, whether a licence fee is required and so on. In all
        cases a high level answer was given explaining that PostgreSQL may be
        freely used, modified and redistributed, and that any further
        questions should be referred to the enquirers legal advisors.</p></li>

    <li><p><b>Significant time spent on pre-CoC conduct issues.</b></p>

       <p>There were two ongoing conduct issues at the time the Code of Conduct
           committee was formed in September 2018. The Core team continued to
           work on these, but did not retroactively apply the Code of Conduct.
           We did enlist the help of the CoC committee to both assist us, and
           give them some experience.</p>

       <p>One of the two issues was relatively simple, whilst the other
           involved a significant amount of investigation and interim bans
           from use of postgresql.org resources due to non-cooperation.
           Cooperation was eventually received from all parties and the matter
           was concluded in mid-May 2019, resulting in one personal and one
           organisational temporary ban from use of PostgreSQL resources. In
           both cases, "time served" was taken into account in determining the
           length of the bans.</p>

    <li><p><b>One conduct issue involving a senior developer dealt with.</b></p>

       <p>One general (non-CoC) issue involving a senior developer was dealt
           with following discussion and deliberations over a number of
           weeks.</p>

    <li><p><b>Significant time dealing with the complications caused by the
    organisational ban discussed above.</b></p>

       <p>The organisational ban implemented had potential ramifications on
           events and parties not involved in the Code of Conduct
           investigation. A great deal of discussion took place to understand
           the effects of the ban on those parties, and how they could be
           minimised.</p></li>

    <li><p><b>A misuse of trademark issue was dealt with.</b></p>

       <p>An organisation registered and started to use a domain name that
           could lead uninformed members of the public to believe that their
           website was the official website of the PostgreSQL community. This
           matter was debated and discussed with the manager of the
           organisation, who elected to use an alternative domain name.</p></li>

    <li><p><b>Ongoing discussions on Patent Policy.</b></p>

       <p>There have been ongoing discussions on the topic of Patent policies,
           culminating in a meeting at PGCon 2019 where the topic was discussed
           with a much wider audience. A policy draft is being produced, which
           will be discussed within the Core team and other interested parties
           (such as the committers), and will then be discussed with legal
           counsel.</p></li>

    <li><p><b>Discussions and subsequent updates to various project policies,
        now all on www.postgresql.org.</b></p>

        <p>The project policies stored on <a
                href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Policies">
            wiki.postgresql.org</a> have all been reviewed, updated where
            appropriate, and moved to the <a href="/about/policies">main
                website</a>.</p></li>
