<p>18 OCTOBER 2018 - The PostgreSQL Global Development Group today announced the
release of PostgreSQL 11, the latest version of the world’s most advanced open
source database.</p>

<p>PostgreSQL 11 provides users with improvements to overall performance of the
database system, with specific enhancements associated with very large databases
and high computational workloads. Further, PostgreSQL 11 makes significant
improvements to the table partitioning system, adds support for stored
procedures capable of transaction management, improves query parallelism and
adds parallelized data definition capabilities, and introduces just-in-time
(JIT) compilation for accelerating the execution of expressions in queries.</p>

<p>"For PostgreSQL 11, our development community focused on adding features that
improve PostgreSQL's ability to manage very large databases," said Bruce
Momjian, a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/developer/core/">core team member</a> of the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL Global Development Group</a>. "On top of
PostgreSQL's proven performance for transactional workloads, PostgreSQL 11 makes
it even easier for developers to run big data applications at scale."</p>

<p>PostgreSQL benefits from over 20 years of open source development and has
become the preferred open source relational database for developers. The project
continues to receive recognition across the industry, and has been featured as
the "<a href="https://db-engines.com/en/blog_post/76">DBMS of the Year 2017</a>" by
DB-Engines and in the
<a href="https://sdtimes.com/sdtimes-100/2018/best-in-show/database-and-database-management-2018/">SD Times 2018 100</a>.</p>

<p>PostgreSQL 11 is the first major release since PostgreSQL 10 was released on
October 5, 2017. The next update release for PostgreSQL 11 containing bug fixes
will be PostgreSQL 11.1, and the next major release with new features will be
PostgreSQL 12.</p>

<h3>Increased Robustness and Performance for Partitioning</h3>

<p>PostgreSQL 11 adds the ability to partition data by a hash key, also known as
hash partitioning, adding to the current ability to partition data in PostgreSQL
by a list of values or by a range. PostgreSQL 11 further improves its data
federation abilities with functionality improvements for partitions that use
the PostgreSQL foreign data wrapper,
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/postgres-fdw.html">postgres_fdw</a>.</p>

<p>To help with managing partitions, PostgreSQL 11 introduces a catch-all default
partition for data that does not match a partition key, and the ability to
create primary keys, foreign keys, indexes, and triggers on partitioned tables
that are passed down to all partitions. PostgreSQL 11 also supports
automatically moving rows to the correct partition if the partition key for that
row is updated.</p>

<p>PostgreSQL 11 improves upon query performance when reading from partitions by
using a new partition elimination strategy. Additionally, PostgreSQL 11 now
supports the popular "upsert" feature on partitioned tables, which helps users
to simplify application code and reduce network overhead when interacting with
their data.</p>

<h3>Transactions Supported in Stored Procedures</h3>

<p>Developers have been able to create user-defined functions in PostgreSQL for
over 20 years, but prior to PostgreSQL 11, these functions were unable to manage
their own transactions. PostgreSQL 11 adds SQL procedures that can perform full
transaction management within the body of a function, enabling developers to
create more advanced server-side applications, such as ones involving
incremental bulk data loading.</p>

<p>SQL procedures can be created using the <code>CREATE PROCEDURE</code> command, executed
using the <code>CALL</code> command, and are supported by the server-side procedural
languages PL/pgSQL, PL/Perl, PL/Python, and PL/Tcl.</p>

<h3>Enhanced Capabilities for Query Parallelism</h3>

<p>PostgreSQL 11 improves parallel query performance, with performance gains in
parallel sequential scans and hash joins along with more efficient scans of
partitioned data. PostgreSQL can now execute SELECT queries that use <code>UNION</code> in
parallel if the underlying queries are unable to be parallelized.</p>

<p>PostgreSQL 11 adds parallelism to several data definition commands, notably for
the creation of B-tree indexes that are generated by executing the standard
<code>CREATE INDEX</code> command. Several data definition commands that either create
tables or materialized views from queries are also parallel capable now,
including the <code>CREATE TABLE .. AS</code>, <code>SELECT INTO</code>, and <code>CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW</code>.</p>

<h3>Just-in-Time (JIT) Compilation for Expressions</h3>

<p>PostgreSQL 11 introduces support for Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to
accelerate the execution of certain expressions during query execution. JIT
expression compilation for PostgreSQL uses the LLVM project to speed up the
execution of expressions in WHERE clauses, target lists, aggregates,
projections, and some internal operations.</p>

<p>To take advantage of JIT compilation, you will need to install the LLVM
dependencies to enable JIT compilation in either your PostgreSQL settings file
by setting <code>jit = on</code> or from your PostgreSQL session by executing
<code>SET jit = on</code>.</p>

<h3>General User Experience Improvements</h3>

<p>The enhancements to the PostgreSQL relational database are not possible without
the feedback from an active user community and the hard work by the people who
work on PostgreSQL. Below highlights a few of the many features included in
PostgreSQL 11 designed to improve the overall user experience:</p>

<ul>
<li>Removing the need for <code>ALTER TABLE .. ADD COLUMN .. DEFAULT ..</code> with a not
<code>NULL</code> default to rewrite the whole table on execution, which provides a
significant performance boost when running this command.</li>

<li>"Covering indexes," which allows a user to add additional columns to an index
using the <code>INCLUDE</code> clause and are helpful for performing index-only scans,
especially on data types that are not indexable by B-tree indexes.</li>

<li>Additional functionality for working with window functions, including allowing
<code>RANGE</code> to use <code>PRECEDING</code>/<code>FOLLOWING</code>, <code>GROUPS</code>, and frame exclusion</li>

<li>The inclusion of the keywords "quit" and "exit" in the PostgreSQL command-line
interface to help make it easier to leave the command-line tool</li>
</ul>
