<h1>PostgreSQL 12 Released!</h1>

<p>
  <strong>OCTOBER 3, 2019</strong> - The PostgreSQL Global Development Group
  today announced the release of <a href="/about/news/1976/">PostgreSQL 12</a>,
  the latest version of the world's <a href="/">most advanced open source database</a>.
</p>

<p>
  PostgreSQL 12 enhancements include notable improvements to query performance,
  particularly over larger data sets, and overall space utilization. This
  release provides application developers with new capabilities such as SQL/JSON
  path expression support, optimizations for how common table expression
  (<code>WITH</code>) queries are executed, and generated columns. The
  PostgreSQL community continues to support the extensibility and robustness of
  PostgreSQL, with further additions to internationalization, authentication,
  and providing easier ways to administrate PostgreSQL. This release also
  introduces the pluggable table storage interface, which allows developers to
  create their own methods for storing data.
</p>

<p>
  "The development community behind PostgreSQL contributed features for
  PostgreSQL 12 that offer performance and space management gains that our users
  can achieve with minimal effort, as well as improvements in enterprise
  authentication, administration functionality, and SQL/JSON support." said Dave
  Page, a <a href="/developer/core/">core team member</a> of the PostgreSQL
  Global Development Group. "This release continues the trend of making it
  easier to manage database workloads large and small while building on
  PostgreSQL's reputation of flexibility, reliability and stability in
  production environments."
</p>

<p>
  PostgreSQL benefits from over 20 years of open source development and has
  become the preferred open source relational database for organizations of all
  sizes. The project continues to receive recognition across the industry,
  including being featured for the second year in a row as the
  <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/blog_post/79" target="_blank">"DBMS of the Year" in 2018</a>
  by DB-Engines and receiving the
  <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/oreilly-open-source-and-frank-willison-awards-19/" target="_blank">"Lifetime Achievement" open source award</a>
  at OSCON 2019.
</p>

<h3>Overall Performance Improvements</h3>

<p>
  PostgreSQL 12 provides significant performance and maintenance enhancements to
  its indexing system and to partitioning.
</p>

<p>
  B-tree Indexes, the standard type of indexing in PostgreSQL, have been
  optimized in PostgreSQL 12 to better handle workloads where the indexes are
  frequently modified. Using a fair use implementation of the TPC-C benchmark,
  PostgreSQL 12 demonstrated on average a 40% reduction in space utilization and
  an overall gain in query performance.
</p>

<p>
  Queries on partitioned tables have also seen demonstrable improvements,
  particularly for tables with thousands of partitions that only need to
  retrieve data from a limited subset. PostgreSQL 12 also improves the
  performance of adding data to partitioned tables with <a href="/docs/12/sql-insert.html"><code>INSERT</code></a>
  and <a href="/docs/12/sql-copy.html"><code>COPY</code></a>, and includes the
  ability to attach a new partition to a table without blocking queries.
</p>

<p>
  There are additional enhancements to indexing in PostgreSQL 12 that affect
  overall performance, including lower overhead in write-ahead log generation
  for the GiST, GIN, and SP-GiST index types, the ability to create covering
  indexes (the <a href="/docs/12/indexes-index-only-scans.html"><code>INCLUDE</code></a> clause) on GiST indexes, the ability to perform
  K-nearest neighbor queries with the distance operator (<code>&lt;-&gt;</code>) using
  SP-GiST indexes, and <a href="/docs/12/sql-createstatistics.html"><code>CREATE STATISTICS</code></a>
  now supporting most-common value (MCV) statistics to help generate better
  query plans when using columns that are nonuniformly distributed.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="/docs/12/jit.html">Just-in-time (JIT) compilation</a> using LLVM, introduced in PostgreSQL 11, is now
  enabled by default. JIT compilation can provide performance benefits to the
  execution of expressions in <code>WHERE</code> clauses, target lists, aggregates, and some
  internal operations, and is available if your PostgreSQL installation is
  compiled or packaged with LLVM.
</p>

<h3>Enhancements to SQL Conformance & Functionality</h3>

<p>
  PostgreSQL is known for its conformance to the SQL standard - one reason why
  it was renamed from "POSTGRES" to "PostgreSQL" - and PostgreSQL 12 adds
  several features to continue its implementation of the SQL standard with
  enhanced functionality.
</p>

<p>
  PostgreSQL 12 introduces the ability to run queries over JSON documents using
  <a href="/docs/12/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-SQLJSON-PATH">JSON path expressions</a>
  defined in the SQL/JSON standard. Such queries may utilize the existing
  indexing mechanisms for documents stored in the <a href="/docs/12/datatype-json.html"><code>JSONB</code></a>
  format to efficiently retrieve data.
</p>

<p>
  Common table expressions, also known as <code>WITH</code> queries, can now be
  automatically inlined by PostgreSQL 12, which in turn can help increase the
  performance of many existing queries. In this release, a <code>WITH</code>
  query can be inlined if it is not recursive, does not have any side-effects,
  and is only referenced once in a later part of a query.
</p>

<p>
  PostgreSQL 12 introduces "<a href="/docs/12/ddl-generated-columns.html">generated columns</a>." Defined in the SQL standard,
  this type of column computes its value from the contents of other columns in
  the same table. In this version, PostgreSQL supports
  "stored generated columns," where the computed value is stored on the disk.
</p>

<h3>Internationalization</h3>

<p>
  PostgreSQL 12 extends its support of ICU collations by allowing users to
  define "<a href="/docs/12/collation.html#COLLATION-NONDETERMINISTIC">nondeterministic collations</a>"
  that can, for example, allow case-insensitive or accent-insensitive comparisons.
</p>

<h3>Authentication</h3>

<p>
  PostgreSQL expands on its robust authentication method support with several
  enhancements that provide additional security and functionality. This release
  introduces both client and server-side encryption for authentication over
  GSSAPI interfaces, as well as the ability for PostgreSQL to discover LDAP
  servers if PostgreSQL is compiled with OpenLDAP.
</p>

<p>
  Additionally, PostgreSQL 12 now supports a form of multifactor authentication.
  A PostgreSQL server can now require an authenticating client to provide a
  valid SSL certificate with their username using the <code>clientcert=verify-full</code>
  option and combine this with the requirement of a separate authentication
  method (e.g. <code>scram-sha-256</code>).
</p>

<h3>Administration</h3>

<p>
  PostgreSQL 12 introduces the ability to rebuild indexes without blocking
  writes to an index via the
  <a href="/docs/12/sql-reindex.html#SQL-REINDEX-CONCURRENTLY"><code>REINDEX CONCURRENTLY</code></a>
  command, allowing users to avoid downtime scenarios for lengthy index rebuilds.
</p>

<p>
  Additionally, PostgreSQL 12 can now enable or disable page checksums in an
  offline cluster using the <a href="/docs/12/app-pgchecksums.html"><code>pg_checksums</code></a> command. Previously page
  checksums, a feature to help verify the integrity of data stored to disk, could only be
  enabled at the time a PostgreSQL cluster was initialized with <code>initdb</code>.
</p>
