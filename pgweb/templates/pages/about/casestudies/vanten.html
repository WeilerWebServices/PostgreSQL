<h2>Finding A Scalable Solution For Large Data Sets</h2>

<p>In a deployment for an ISP backed by DaieiOMC, Japan.s 5th largest credit card company, Vanten sought a solution that would <b>support their large data sets</b> as well as <b>scale with the growth of their business</b>.  The goal was a system that could handle data for hundreds of thousands of ISP users while <b>not adding significant cost to the implementation</b>.</p>

<h2>PostgreSQL Scales To Fit The Task, And At The Right Price</h2>

<p>Vanten selected PostgreSQL as one of the key components for their solution, relying on the <b>power and extensibility of the database</b> even under heavy load.</p>

<p>Integrating with other Open Source technology and taking advantage of the "free" licensing of the PostgreSQL technology, Vanten was able to <b>keep their costs down</b> significantly and pass the savings onto their customer.</p>
