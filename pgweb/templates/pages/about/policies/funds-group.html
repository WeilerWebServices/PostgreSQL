<h1>PostgreSQL Funds Group <i class="far fa-money-bill-alt"></i></h1>

<p><em>Last updated: March 1, 2019</em></p>

<h2 id="charter">Charter</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Governance Charter of the Relationship</strong> between the PostgreSQL
  project and Software in the Public Interest, Inc.
</p>

<h3>Core Team Membership</h3>

<p>
  The <a href="/developer/core/">Core Team</a> of the PostgreSQL project
  currently consists of the following people:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Peter Eisentraut</li>
  <li>Magnus Hagander</li>
  <li>Tom Lane</li>
  <li>Bruce Momjian</li>
  <li>Dave Page</li>
</ul>

<p>The Core Team appoints its own members.</p>

<h3>Fundraising Group Membership</h3>

<p>
  The Fundraising Group (a.k.a. Funds Group) of the PostgreSQL project initially
  consisted of the members of The PostgreSQL Foundation Inc. that were active at
  the time of its termination. Thereafter, the Fundraising Group appoints its
  own members using the normal procedures for proposals and votes, as described
  below. The current membership is shown
  <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PGFGMembers">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>Fundraising Group Elected Positions</h3>

<p>
  The Fundraising Group elects an SPI Liaison and an Deputy SPI Liaison. The
  appointments are subject to the veto of the Core Team. The appointments do not
  have an explicit duration, but either may be replaced at any time using the
  normal procedures for proposals and votes, as described below.
</p>

<p>
  The duty of the SPI Liaison is primarily to represent the interests and
  decisions of the Fundraising Group to SPI. Additionally the SPI Liaison will
  submit to SPI on an ongoing basis a list of persons eligible for automatic SPI
  contributing membership in recognition of their contributions to the
  PostgreSQL project.
</p>

<p>
  The duty of the Deputy SPI Liaison is to perform the duties of the SPI Liaison
  in the case that the SPI Liaison is unavailable for a non-trivial amount of
  time, or upon explicit request of the SPI Liaison or the Fundraising Group.
</p>

<h3>Proposals and Voting</h3>

<p>
  Proposals must be made explicitly via email on the funds group
  <a href="mailto:funds-group@lists.postgresql.org">mailing list</a>, and be
  seconded prior to discussion and voting.
</p>

<p>
  Decisions require discussion and voting in accordance with
  <a href="#votes">how the fundraising group votes</a> in order to be valid.
</p>

  Collectors must agree to this responsibility. If they reject the request,
  other members must be selected until 2 are found which agree. If no members
  are specifically selected, the default Vote Collectors are the SPI Liaison and
  the Alternate SPI Liaison.

    address subscribed to the Funds Group mailing list
  </li>
  <li>Both Vote Collectors will tabulate the votes independently</li>

<h4>Fund Requests</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="#requests">Fund requests</a> must be for reimbursement of
