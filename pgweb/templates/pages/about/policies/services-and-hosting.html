<h2>Policies for Approving Professional Services and Hosting Services</h2>

<h3>General Rules</h3>

<p>The www.postgresql.org home page contains Professional Services and Hosting
    (in general, Services) listings which are maintained entirely for the
    benefit of the PostgreSQL community. As this space would be quite valuable
    if commercially available, our admins have the authority to be restrictive
    about what they allow on the home page.</p>

<p>All Services to be approved must include the following information:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Company Name</li>
    <li>Accurate and complete contact information, including e-mail, web, phone,
        and address of registered office
    </li>
    <li>A 15 to 50 word summary of the company's services which provides some
        detail about which specific services the company offers for PostgreSQL.
    </li>
    <li>Geographic location information</li>
</ul>

<p>Further, the web site you link to in the listing must somewhere mention
    PostgreSQL as an offered service or platform. If PostgreSQL is not mentioned
    anywhere on your website, then your listing will not be approved.</p>

<p>Also, do not list your company in every single geographic region unless you
    are a truly worldwide company (e.g. IBM, Akamai). This may be reason to
    reject your listing.</p>

<p>Other General Rules include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>All services must be related to PostgreSQL in some direct and obvious
        way.
    </li>
    <li>Link-only listings (no description or details) will never be
        acceptable.
    </li>
    <li>The WWW admin group of the PostgreSQL project may permanently ban any
        organization which is the cause of substantiated complaints about
        accuracy, ethics or legality from members of our community.
    </li>
    <li>The WWW team makes no promises about timely approval of announcements.
        If publication on a specific day is critical to you, you will need to
        contact the pgsql-www mailing list or a core team member prior to the
        submission.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Professional Services and Listings</h3>

<p>For Professional Services, the "provides support and services" check box must
    be checked. Fill out the following form blanks with the listed information.
    Incomplete submissions may be rejected.</p>

<ul>
    <li>URL: your (or your company's) website, it must contain information about
        the PostgreSQL services you provide.
    </li>
    <li>Number of Employees: number of staff you have doing PostgreSQL support
        or consulting.
    </li>
    <li>Hours: the hours support is available. Suggested options include
        "Business Hours (time zone)", "24x7", "As Arranged"
    </li>
    <li>Languages: what human languages you provide support and services in,
        e.g. Spanish, English, Japanese, etc.
    </li>
    <li>Customer Example: if available</li>
    <li>Experience: detail of your staff's PostgreSQL and related technology
        experience only.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Hosting Listings</h3>

<p>If you offer web hosting for PostgreSQL applications, please check the
    "Provides hosting of PostgreSQL databases"</p>

<p>Supported Interfaces should detail what programming languages (e.g. Perl,
    Java, Ruby, etc.) and/or what database applications (e.g. Drupal, xTuple,
    OpenACS, etc.) you specifically have support for. Also include any notes in
    this space about limitations or special features of your PostgreSQL
    hosting.</p>

<p>Your web site must specifically list PostgreSQL as a supported hosted
    application if you list the other applications which you support on your
    hosting platform.</p>

<h3>Removal</h3>

<p>Professional Services and Hosting listings are offered purely and entirely
    for the benefit of our not-for-profit member community. Postgresql.org is
    not an advertising service or publication. If our admins feel that your
    listing is inconsistent with the good of our community, your listing may be
    removed for any reason, or no reason.</p>

<p>Specific reasons which are likely to get your listing removed include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Community member complaints about the quality of your services</li>
    <li>Community member reports that your company cannot be contacted</li>
    <li>Failure to list PostgreSQL services or hosting as available on your web
        site
    </li>
    <li>Use of postgresql.org, its mailing lists, or associated forums and
        communications for aggressive or cold-call sales campaigns
    </li>
</ul>

<p>If your listing is removed, the admins will usually notify you of the reason
    for removal, though such notice is not guaranteed.</p>
